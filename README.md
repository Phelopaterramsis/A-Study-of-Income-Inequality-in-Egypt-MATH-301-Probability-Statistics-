## 📘 Project Overview  
This project studies **income inequality in Egypt**—a key aspect of broader social inequality—by statistically analyzing the relationships between annual income and three major demographic factors:

- **Gender** of household head  
- **Education level**  
- **Household size**  

Using frequency tables from **CAPMAS**, we applied hypothesis testing, Pearson correlation analysis, and significance testing to reveal how these social factors shape income outcomes.  
The full report and proposal are included.

## 🧠 Methodology

### **1. Data Collection**  
Data was obtained from several CAPMAS datasets covering:

- Income distribution  
- Gender of household head  
- Number of household members  
- Education levels  


Tables summarizing these datasets appear on pages 7–8 of the report.

### **2. Statistical Tools Used**
- **Pearson correlation coefficient**  
- **One-tailed hypothesis tests (z-test)**  
- **Significance testing of correlation coefficients (t-test)**  
- **Data visualization (bar charts, box plots)**  

The study uses middle-point income classes and large-sample approximations (normal distribution).  


### **3. Proposal Summary**  
The project proposal (included in this folder) outlines:

- Focus on income inequality as a subset of social inequality  
- Examination of occupation, education, housing, and gender  
- Use of CAPMAS datasets and descriptive + inferential statistics

## 📈 Results

### **A. Gender & Income**  
Bar charts (page 9) show a **large gender pay gap**, with female household heads concentrated in lower income brackets.  
Hypothesis testing confirms:  
\[
H_0 : \mu_F \ge \mu_M \quad \text{rejected}
\]  
\[
H_1 : \mu_F < \mu_M \quad \text{accepted}
\]  
z ≈ **–172**, an extremely strong indicator of inequality.

### **B. Education & Income**  
Graph on page 10 shows that income increases with education level:  
- Illiterate avg ≈ 50,794 EGP  
- University-level avg ≈ 80,328 EGP  

However, Pearson results reveal an interesting pattern:  
Only the highest education level shows a strong positive correlation; many intermediate levels show weak or even **negative** correlations, pointing to structural inequality.  


---

### **C. Household Size & Income**  
Surprisingly, CAPMAS data shows that:  
- Wealthier households tend to have **more members**  
- The strongest positive correlation appears in the “6+ members” categories  


This contradicts the common assumption that poorer households are larger.

## 📊 Statistical Significance  
Every tested correlation (education–income, gender–income, household size–income) was found to be **statistically significant at α = 0.01**.

## 📎 Conclusion  
Our findings confirm the presence of **systemic income inequality** in Egypt influenced by gender biases, educational access, and household structure.  
Women earn substantially less than men, education access strongly impacts income distribution, and wealthy households surprisingly tend to be larger.

This project highlights the need for evidence-based policies aimed at improving educational access, reducing gender discrimination, and addressing structural inequalities across socioeconomic classes.
